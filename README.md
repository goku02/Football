# Football

## Usage: For showing league standings: **python LiveScore.py get_standings -l171**

## TODO: 
* Use Termgraph to show bars for displaying points in league standings
* Use matplotlib to display graphs showing the rise/fall for teams in their league
* Show fixtures(probably for next week/month) with their current form(maybe 5 previous results)
